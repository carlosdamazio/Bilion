# Billion
It's a toy programming language for learning purposes.

It's really in the beginning of development, we are still building the lexer.
Parser and other stuff is not even designed yet, so stay tuned.

## Syntax
```
$ make
$ ./billion hello.bil
```

For now, the language only supports printing strings.

```text
exposed("Hello, world!\n");
```

## Building
You'll need `gcc` and `make` in order to compile and link the compiler.

After grabbing the dependencies, just run make:
```bash
$ make
```
